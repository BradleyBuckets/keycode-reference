# keycode-reference

So it looks like in a recent update, keyCode has been deprecated. After some inital research, it looks like the standard is to move away from using keyCodes and towards key and code. This allows for different keyboards to still process the same keystrokes. Although I think that since keyCodes are still supported, just deprecated and you should move away from them, that I needed to make a new reference page.
